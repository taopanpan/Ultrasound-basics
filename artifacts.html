  Shadows
</h4>
<br>
Both air and bone will attenuate the ultrasound beam almost totally,
thus creating a shadow. However, a shadow has different effects
depending on the distance from the probe. A distant shadow will simply
create a drop out behind the shadowing object. On the other hand, a
shadow close to the probe will simply reduce the effective aperture,
thus not creating a drop out, but instead reducing the lateral
resolution. The principle is illustrated below.

transducer surface (e.g. lung edge or rib) will result in a narrow beam
(reduced apparent aperture) which will not be seen as a shadow in the
picture, but rather a reduced lateral resolution.&nbsp; (Original

  Reverberations:
</h4>
Reverberations is defined as the sound remaing in a particular space
after the original sound pulse has passed.
<br>
Thus, a single echo is a reverberation (first order), and multiple
echoes will be higher order reverberations as illustrated below.
<br>
the phenomenon that a sound pulse bounce back
between different structures before being reflected back to the
observer. ,
while in ultrasound iomages the term is usually restricted to artefacts
caused by the echo bouncing more times (higher order reverberations) ,
creating false images
<br>
The phenomenon of thunder is a typical reverberation effect:

  </b>
  <b>a short, sharp crack</b>
</small>
.
<b>
  <small>
    The wavefront of that sound (red) reaches the listener first, but the
wavefront is then reflected from different cloud surfaces with
different distance to the listener as secondary echoes, ( primary
reverberations; blue and
green), an also tertiary echo (Secondary reverberation; yellow) and
even higher orders. Thus, the crack is
"smeared out" to a long lasting rumble.

    In ultrasound imaging, actually the primary echoes
are first order reverberations. However, in ultrasound images the term
is usually restricted to artefacts
caused by the echo bouncing more times (higher order reverberations) ,
creating false images as the partial delay due to multiple reflections
will be interpreted as images at greater and different
depths. One of the most typical phenomenons are the stationary
reverberations caused by the bouncing of the pulse between a structure
close to the surface, and the probe surface:
    <br></div>
</div>
<br>
<a name="stationary_reverberations"></a>
Stationary reverberations are
caused by stationary structures, usually in the chest wall, causing the
ultrasound to bounce back and forth between the skin and the structure,
increasing the time before the echo returns and giving rise to a false
image of an apparent stationary structure deeper down.

  <span style="font-weight: bold;">
    Left, the principle of
stationary reverberations, showing how the ultrasound pulse bounces
twice between a stationary structure in the body wall and the surface
(thick line), causing the reflected pulse to arrive the transducer
three times as late as if it hadn't bounced (dotted, thick line). This
is then interpreted as the reflector being located three times it's
true depth. Right, the appearance&nbsp; in grey scale image, see the
stationary echo in the lateral wall (arrows).
  </span>
  <br>
  <big>
    <br>
    Reverberations needs not necessarily be totally stationary, if the
reflecting surface that gives rise to the echo moves, the
reverberations will move as well.
    <br>
    Also, the echoes may be scatered in all directions, the pulse may
bounce in different directions (as in the thunder animation above)
before part of the reflected pulse reaches the probe. This will not
give a distinct echo like the one above, but rather more diffuse, less
dense shadows, as in the example below:

            By first glance, this image seems to have
OK image quality. The endocardium seems well defined around most of the
wall. However, the lateral wall shows good definition mostly in the
latter half of the cycle. And shadowy reverberations can be seen in
both base and midwall.

    Shadowy reverberations may seem of little importance, as the B-mode
often is faily well visualised anyway. This is partluy duye to the
motion, and partly due to the
    <a href="http://folk.ntnu.no/stoylen/strainrate/Ultrasound/#Harmonic">second harmonic mode</a>
    ,
which reduces the amplitude of reverberation noise, but only in the
B-mode, as

      tissue Doppler must be done in

    Stationary echoes and noise is also referred to as "clutter". This
noise may also result in a more random pattern (shadowy
reverberations), resulting in a more blurred picture.

        For correct display of the left ventricle, the imaging plane has to
transect the apex. This is ensured by finding the apex beat by
palpation. However, the apex does not necessarily offer the optimal
window for imaging, and the intercostal space above may give a better
view. However, this may lead to a geometrical distortion as illustrated

            The anterior wall is partly apical and partly circumferential.
Thus longitudinal shortening, especially by speckle tracking may be
circumferential rather than longitudinal. This may also be related to

    Non linear propagation of the signal in the body, leads to distortion
of the waves in the signal. But this again leads to a dispersion of the
wavelength content in the signal, as assessed by Fourier analysis in
the received signal.

    By Fourier analysis it is thus possible to send at half the frequency
(typical 1.7 MHz as opposed to 3.4 MHz in native imaging), but receive
at the same frequency (the second harmonic frequency: Twice the
frequency is one octave higher). Thus, it improves penetration, which
is important especially in obese subjects, while it retains the
resolution (almost).

            The noise from clutter and
aberrations is mainly in the primary frequency, so the use of second
harmonic will suppress noise, improving the noise-to-signal ratio.
Also, the echoes from the side lobes are mainly in the primary
frequency and will be reduced in second harmonic imaging.
            <br>
            Thus second harmonic imaging leads to:

speckle pattern (oval dots) as the amplitude is increased where wave
crests cross each other, while the waves are neutralised where a wave
crest crosses a though. This can be seen by throwing two stones
simultaneously in still water . The speckle pattern can be seen in

          Humpback whale diving. Each
humpback has an unique (speckle) pattern on the underside of the tail
(and flukes). Thus each individual can be identified by its speckle
pattern. Photographs at different times and places can thus track the
wandering of each individual all over the area it wanders, without
recourse to anything else than the pattern.&nbsp; - Speckle tracking!
This is thus a method with low frame rate, giving mainly the extent of
wandering over a long time period (the sampling interval). To measure
swimming velocity, a Doppler sonar would have been useful.

    The randomness of the
speckle pattern ensures that each region of the myocardium has its own
unique speckle pattern: that can differentiate a region from other
regions (just as in the whales).

          The two enlarged areas show completely
different speckle patterns, which is due to the randomness of the
interference. This creates an unique pattern for any selected region
that can identify this region and hence, the displacement of the region
in the next&nbsp; frame.

        The speckle pattern remains
reasonably stable, and the speckles follow the myocardial motion. This

                  An
M-mode along the septum demonstrates how the speckles is shown as
motion curves. It is evident that many speckles are only visible during
part of the heart cycle, but if the speckle pattern is compared from
frame to frame, the changes will be small. The grainy texture of the
lines is due to the limited frame rate as the M-mode on the right is
reconstructed from the 2D image at the left.

                  When the
speckle pattern is followed by an M-mode in the wall, the alternating

The lines remaining to a large degree unbroken, shows the pattern to be
relatively stable, the speckles moving along with the true myocardial
motion, and thus myocardial motion can be tracked by the speckles.

cross correlation (

        ,
        <a href="http://folk.ntnu.no/stoylen/strainrate/References.html#r27">27</a>
        ). However, the speckle pattern
will not repeat perfectly. This is due to both true out of plane motion
(rotation and torsion relative to apical planes and longitudinal
deformation relative to short axis planes) and to small changes in the
interference pattern. But the frame to frame change is small, and the
approach to recognition is statistical. This means, however, that the
search should be done from frame to frame, the changes over longer time
intervals will be to great.

        In principle, pure speckle tracking&nbsp; is direction independent, and
can track crosswise. However, lateral resolution is important in
delineating the speckles in the lateral direction. If the lateral
resolution is low,&nbsp; the interpolation will result in a "smeared"
picture, with speckles that are nor so easily tracked in the lateral
direction. In addition the lateral resolution decreases in depth with
sector probes.

                  As can be seen, with a drop
out apicolateral, this ROI tracks less than perfect, giving too low
strain both in LA and MA segments.

                  Speckle tracking can be applied
crosswise. In this parasternal long axis view, the myocardial motion is
tracked both in axial and transverse (longitudinal) direction. It is
evident that the tracking is far poorer in the inferior wall, due to
the poor lateral resolution at greater depth.

        However, drop outs and reverberations will affect the tracking, and in
the lateral direction, low lateral resolution will "
        <a href="http://folk.ntnu.no/stoylen/strainrate/Ultrasound/#Lateral">smear</a>
        "
the speckles in the lateral direction, making tracing less perfect, as
can be seen in the parasternal long axis image above. It also means
that the lateral tracking will be poorer with increasing depth (as the
lines diverge as well as becoming wider), as also discussed
        <a href="http://folk.ntnu.no/stoylen/strainrate/measurements.html#Lateral_tracking">
          in the measurements
section
        </a>
        .
        <br>
        The speckle pattern will not repeat perfectly. This is due to both true
out of plane motion (rotation and torsion relative to apical planes and
longitudinal deformation relative to short axis planes) and to small
changes in the interference pattern. But the frame to frame change is
small, and the approach to recognition is statistical, the basic
algorithms are shown
        <a href="http://folk.ntnu.no/stoylen/strainrate/mathemathics/index.html#speckle">here</a>
        .
Still, small inaccuracies in tracking may cause over all drift in the
tracking, as discussed more in detail in the
        <a href="http://folk.ntnu.no/stoylen/strainrate/measurements.html#drift_in_ST">measurement section</a>

            Drift in ultrasound. As speckles
disappear out of plane, or by changing interference pattern, this may
cause less than perfect tracking.

          <br></div>
        <br>
        This means, however, that the with l
        <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ower frame rate</span>
        , the
changes from frame to frame are greater, resulting in poorer tracking.
        <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Higher heart rate</span>
        (f.i. in
stress) will result in the same, as the number of frames per cycle will
be reduced, i.e. lower relative frame rates.
        <br>
        Thus: speckle tracking is frame rate sensitive:
        <br>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Too low frame rate will result in too great changes from frame to
frame, resulting in poor tracking. This may also limit the use in high
heart rates, as the motion and thus frame to frame change increases
relative to the frame rate.
            <br></li>
          <li>
            Too high frame rate is obtained by reduced
            <a href="http://folk.ntnu.no/stoylen/strainrate/Ultrasound/#TGC_and_FR_latres">lateral resolution</a>
            , and thus resulting
in poorer tracking at least in the transverse direction.
            <br></li>
        </ol>
        Thus, both too high and too low frame rate may affect speckle tracking
adversely. With the present equipment, the optimal frame rate seems to
be between 40 - 70 if image quality is good, slightly higher with
poorer image quality.
        <br>
        As speckle tracking can track in both transverse and axial directions,
with a sufficient number of kernels, deformation can in principle be
measured in two dimensions, as as discussed in the section about a new
application called "
        <a href="http://folk.ntnu.no/stoylen/strainrate/index.html#2D_strain">2D strain</a>
        ".
        <br>
        It's also important in dealing with
        <span style="font-style: italic;">applications</span>
        to realise that not all apparent tracking is true speckle tracking,
some of themotion seen in the image may be due to an advanced algorithm
using information from other parts of the image:

          <small>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">
              False speckle tracking. This is
due to the algorithm using motion data from the mitral ring,
distributing it along the ROI in a kind of "model" of the motion for
smoothing, in order to reduce the imapact of drift and other sources of
noise. As can be seen, in this image it "tracks" even if there are no
speckles. This, however, is not true tracking, the bullets move
according to the model calculating where they should be

        .
        <br>
        Within its limitations, however, speckle tracking can be used for
measuring displacement, velocity, strain and strain rate as described

          The Doppler effect was discovered by Christian Andreas Doppler (1803
- 1853), and shows how the frequency of an emitted&nbsp; wave changes
with the velocity of the emitter or observer. The theory was presented
in the royal Bohemian society of Science in 25th of May1842 (5
listeners at the occasion!), and published in 1843 (
          <a href="http://folk.ntnu.no/stoylen/strainrate/References.html#r119">119</a>
          ). The premises for his
theoretical work was faulty, as he built his theory on the work of
James Bradley who erroneously attributed the apparent motion of stars
against the background (parallax effect) to the velocity of the earth
in its orbit (instead of the effect of Earth's position in orbit on the
angle of observation). Further, Doppler attributed the differences in
colour of different stars to be due to the Doppler effect, assuming all
stars to be white.&nbsp; Finally, he theoretised over the effect of the
motion&nbsp; of double stars that rotate around each other, assuming
a&nbsp; Doppler effect&nbsp; from the motion.&nbsp; The changes in
wavelength from the Doppler effect, however, is too small to be
observed.
          <br></p>
        <p>
          However, Doppler did a theoretical derivation of the effect of the
motion of the source or observer on the perceived wavelength from the
premises of a constant propagation velocity of the waves in the medium,
and this is entirely correct, valid both for sound waves and
electromagnetic radiation of all kinds. The basis for the Doppler
effect is that the propagation velocity of the waves in a medium is
constant, so the waves propagates with the same velocity in all
directions, and thus there is no addition of the velocity of the waves
and the velocity of the source. Thus, as the source moves in the
direction of the propagation of the waves, this does not increase the
propagation velocity of the waves, but instead increases the
frequency.The original derivation of the Doppler principle as well as
the extension to reflected waves is explained in more detail
          <a href="http://folk.ntnu.no/stoylen/strainrate/mathemathics/index.html#Doppler">here</a>
          . As a work of
theoretical physics, it is thus extremely important. In addition, it
has become of practical importance, as&nbsp; the basis for the
astronomical measurement of the velocity of galaxies by the red shift
of the spectral lines, in Doppler radar, Doppler laser and Doppler
ultrasound.
        </p>
        <p>
          The theory was experimentally validated by the Dutchman Christoph
Hendrik Diderik Buys Ballot (
          <a href="http://folk.ntnu.no/stoylen/strainrate/References.html#r120">120</a>
          ),
with the Doppler effect on sound waves, who placed musicians along a
railway line and on a flatbed truck, all blowing the same note, and
observed by subjects with absolute pitch, who observed the tones being
a half note higher when the train was approaching as compared to the
stationary musicians, and a half note lower as the train receded.
          <br></p>
        <p>
          (This can be observed in everyday phenomena such as the sound of
f.i. an ambulance siren, the pitch (frequency) is higher when the
ambulance is coming towards the observer, hanging as it passes,&nbsp;
and lower as it goes away.
