              The Doppler
effect. As the velocity of sound in air (or any other medium ) is
constant, the sound wave will propagate outwards in all directions with
the same velocity, with the center at the point where it was emitted.
As the engine moves, the next sound wave is emitted from a point
further forward, i.e. with the center a little further forward. Thus
the distance between the wave crests is decreased in the direction of
the motion, and increased in the opposite direction. As the distance
between the wave crests is equal to the wavelength, wavelength
decreases (i.e. sound frequency increases) in front of the engine, and
increases (sound frequency decreases) behind it. This effect can be
heard, as the pitch of the train whistle&nbsp; is higher coming towards
a listener than moving away, changing as it passes. The effect on the
pitch of the train whistle was published directly, but later than
Doppler and Buys Ballot.

        <div style="text-align: left;">
          If the sound source is stationary, the
effect on&nbsp; moving observer is similar. The train will meet the
wave crest with shorter intervals, as the train moves into the incoming
sound. In ultrasound, the wave is sent from a stationary transducer,
the moving blood or muscle is&nbsp; firstly moving towards the
transducer and then following the reflected wave towards the
transducer, thus the Doppler shift is approximately twice as great. In
the case of reflected ultrasound, the Doppler shift is:

                      The Doppler frequencies are distributed according to
this frequency - amplitude diagram. The Tissue echoes has high
amplitude of the reflected signal, but low velocities (resulting in low
Doppler frequencies). Blood has higher velocities 8with a wider
distribution), but lower amplitude. The signal is filtered. For Doppler
flow, a high pass filter (low velocity reject) is applied to suppress
the tissue echoes. The filter is variable, and thus can be applied to
select for v very high velocities in insufficiency jets. A low pass
filter (high velocity reject) can be applied to suppress noise above
the velocity range. In tissue Doppler, the high pass filter can be
removed, or at least partially, to allow the low velocities from the
tissue (usually on the order of 1/10 of flow). It can partially be
maintained to suppress absolutely stationary echoes, among other from
the reverberations. The blood signal can be removed both by reducing
the gain, and by applying a low pas filter. For detailed explanation

                In the heart, the velocities are variable with time. Thus the velocity,
or frequency shift is a function of time. At the same time, the
amplitude is a function of the velocities, as the velocities will
be&nbsp; concentrated in a narrow band.&nbsp; To display this, an
approach similar to the M-mode can be applied. Amplitude is displayed
as brightness, in a manners similar to B.mode, while Frequency /
Velocity are displayed on the y - axis and time on the x - axis. This
results in the typical Doppler flow velocity curves:

                </h4>
                As can be seen from the illustrations above, the velocity spectrum has
a certain width. In the blood, this partly reflects the spread of
velocities between the multiple scatterers in the blood, as shown below:

                </div>
                <br>
                However, this is not the only explanation. As the bandwidth is a
function of the pulse length as illustrated
                <a href="http://folk.ntnu.no/stoylen/strainrate/Ultrasound/#Depth_res">above</a>
                ,
spectral analysis will yield a spectrum that minimum is as wide as the
bandwidth. Ideally, the pulse length in Doppler should be long, in
order to increase velocity resolution. However, this will reduce the
spatial (axial) resolution.
                <br>
                Thus, if the dispersion of velocities is larger than the bandwidth, as
in flow measurements, this is the most important. On the other hand, if
there is little dispersion of velocities, as in
                <a href="http://folk.ntnu.no/stoylen/strainrate/Ultrasound/#Peak_values">
                  tissue
Doppler
                </a>
                , the width of the spectrum reflects the bandwidth.
                <br>
                But the insonation angle also has an influence, not only in the
velocity measurement according to the Doppler equation. but also in the
bandwidth as shown below.
                <br>
                <div style="text-align: center;">

                  <br>
                  <small>
                    As can be seen, the direction of the motion&nbsp; of the
scatterer in relation to the direction of the pulse, may influence the
number of oscillations that are actually used for measurement. Thus, a
high&nbsp; insonation angle is equivalent to a virtual shortening of
the pulse length, and results in a wider bandwidth (spectrum).
                  </small>
                  <br></div>
                <br>

                <a href="http://folk.ntnu.no/stoylen/strainrate/Ultrasound/#reverb">stationary reverberations</a>
                , creating
artificially stationary echoes will result in
                <a href="http://folk.ntnu.no/stoylen/strainrate/Ultrasound/#modal_in_reverb">widening of the spectrum in tissue Doppler</a>
                .
In flow, this will basically be removed by the high pass filter.

                  Pulsed and continuous wave Doppler:
                </h3>
                Doppler pulses can either be used as a pulsed Doppler, where a pulse is
sent out, and the frequency shift in the reflected pulse is measured
after a certain time. This will correspond to a certain depth (range
gating), i.e. velocity is measured at a specific depth, which can be
adjusted. The width is the same as the beam width, and the length of
the sample volume is equal to the length of the pulse. The same
transducer is used both for transmitting and receiving.
                <br>
                A problem in pulsed Doppler is that the Doppler shift is very small
compared to the ultrasound frequency. This makes it problematic to
estimate the Doppler shift from a single pulse, without increasing the
pulse length too far. A velocity of 100 cm/s with a ultrasound
frequency of 3.5 MHz results in a maximum Doppler shift of&nbsp; 2.3
KHz. The solution to this problem is shooting multiple pulses in the
same direction and produce a new signal with one sample from each
pulse, the Doppler curve from this signal will be a new curve with the
frequency equal to the Doppler shift. (This means that a full package
of pulses is considered one pulse in the sampling frequency sense).
                <br>
                The pulsed modus results in a practical limit on the maximum velocity
that can be measured. In order to measure velocity at a certain depth,
the next pulse cannot be sent out before the signal is returned.&nbsp;
The Doppler shift is thus sampled once for every pulse that is
transmitted, and the sampling frequency is thus equal to the pulse
repetition frequency (PRF). Frequency aliasing occurs at a Doppler
shift that is equal to half of the PRF.

between the sampling frequency and the observed velocity. If you sample
at a certain frequency, the direction of the motion becomes ambiguous,
more frequent sampling will give the correct direction, less
frequent&nbsp; sampling results in an apparent motion in the opposite
direction. This can be observed with a stroboscopic light, for instance
illuminating the flow of water, or with old fashioned wagon wheels in

velocity. In the images below, the frames are seen to shift
simultaneously, but the positions of the red dots are different due to
the different rotational velocity.

Thus, there is no information about the time interval from the signal
to the reflection, and, hence, no information about the depth of the
received signal; the signal may come from any depth. The continuous

achieve a sufficient depth resolution.

        A way around the problem, is to use high pulse repetition frequency
pulsed Doppler. This means that one or more new pulses are sent out
before the echo from the desired depth of the first is received. This
will increase the pulse repetition frequency, and thus increase the
Nykvist limit as the f
        <sub>N</sub>
        = ½ * PRF. On the other hand
it will be impossible to determine which pulse is the origin of the
echo, and thus it will result in a partial depth ambiguity.

in the possibility to analyse the Doppler shift in terms of the phase
shift between the pulses. The phase shift analysis is based on the
principle that when pulse 2 hits a moving scatterer, the scatterer will
have moved a little away from, or towards the probe, and the return
pulse 2 will then be in&nbsp; a different phase from pulse 1. The
distance the scatterer has moved, is of course a function of the
velocity of the scatterer and the time between pulses given by the
pulse repetition frequency, thus:

exactly as in pulsed Doppler. In this case, the PRF is 1/t, the time
delay between the two pulses in one package. In order to obtain an
acceptable Nykvist limit, the PRF need to be at least 1 KHz which will

          </span>
          The time between
the two pulses represent 1/PRF; determining the Nykvist limit. The time
between two packages is 1/FR. The time between packages can be used for
sampling B-mode data for a B-mode image in a composite image.
          <br>
          The method will give the velocity at a certain depth, depending on the
          <a href="http://folk.ntnu.no/stoylen/strainrate/Ultrasound/#pw_and_cw">range gating</a>
          as in pulsed Doppler.
          <small>
            <big>
              By
gating multiple sampling times from the same pulse package in post
processing, the Doppler shift can be measured at multiple depths along
the line. As opposed to HPRF, only one pulse package can be sent out
along one line in order to await the return signal down to maximum
depth (range), in order to avoid range ambiguity. This means that the
method is more similar to B-mode than HPRF, and the velocity ambiguity
is similar to pulsed Doppler. In fact, colour Doppler can be seen as a
B-mode, where the phase (or frequency) shift is analysed instead of the
amplitude, stored as numerical values in each pixel (as amplitude is in
B-mode), but displayed as colour instead of brightness.
              <br>
              This again means that in order to build a sector, the next package has
to be sent along next line, and a new package can only be sent out
along the first line when a complete set of scan lines has been built
up. Thus the time between packages in one line, and hence, the temporal
resolution, is dependent on the frame rate, just as in B-mode as
described
              <a href="http://folk.ntnu.no/stoylen/strainrate/Ultrasound/#temporal">above</a>
              . The temporal resolution can
be increased by reducing sector depth, sector width and line density.
In addition, sampling at longer gating intervals, due to one package
being two pulses, reduces radial (depth) resolution. However, as the
region of flow is only the cavity, and the region of interest usually
being only part of this, reducing sector size in order to obtain an
acceptable frame rate is a feasible solution as shown below.

depth diagram of the position of a moving scatterer. Each dot represent
one pulse. Packages of two pulses are sent to the scatterer with
intervals. The time between the pulses in one package is given by
1/PRF, and decides the Nykvist limit. The time between packages is the
time it takes to build a full sector of lines in colour flow mode (CFM)
and is given by the frame rate (FR), the time interval being 1/FR. This
decides the temporal resolution of the CFM.

density and sampling frequency, the CFM image can achieve an acceptable
frame rate.&nbsp; This is feasible because the region of interest for
the flow is usually only a part of the ROI for The B-mode, ,flow being

              In principle, two pulses are sufficient for phase analysis with perfect
signals. However, more than two pulses can be used in order to make the
analysis more robust, in the autocorrelation method. This results in
better accuracy (reliability) of the velocity estimate. This, however
increases the duration of each package (as the time between two pulses
is 1/PRF, a package of N pulses will have a duration of N-1/PRF), and
thus it will affect frame rate.
              <br>
              A theoretical frame rate of 1 KHz will make the use of packets
unnecessary (as then PRF = FR, and phase analysis can be done from one
puls to the next, with the same Nykvist frequency). This is technically
feasible (

              2D colour flow gives mainly information on
the direction of velocities, as well as colour M-mode giving the
direction - timing information. However, the information is numerical,
and can be extracted as is done in colour tissue Doppler, but this
gives far less accurate values than pulsed and cw Doppler, as well as a
reduced frame rate.

This will result in a values that does not reflect the spectrum, but
only mean values in the spectrum. But if there is clutter in the region
(stationary echoes), this will be incorporated in the mean, resulting
ion lower values. In Doppler flow, this can be filered by the high pass
filter, and thus will represent a small problem. In

          </a>
          , this may be a more significant problem, as the velocities
are only about 1/10 of the flow values, and thus clutter may be more
difficult to separate from true velocities. Thus, a substantial amunt
of clutter may reduce autocorrelation values for tissue Doppler more
than pulsed Doppler as discussed
          <a href="http://folk.ntnu.no/stoylen/strainrate/Ultrasound/#Peak_values">below</a>
          .
In addition, it is customary to analyse the tissue Doppler values in
native, rather than harmonic imaging, due to the
          <a href="http://folk.ntnu.no/stoylen/strainrate/Ultrasound/#Harmonic_TDI">
            Nykvist
limitation
          </a>

harmonic imaging had been used,

          For optimal colour flow,
it is important to realise that there may, in some scanners, be an
inverse relation between the gain of colour Doppler and B-mode. (In
some scanners it is possible to adjust the priority, or to adjust the
gain settings separately). This, however, is an acquisition finction,
and not image adjustment, and thus cannot be compensated afterwards.
This is illustrated below:
