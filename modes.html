<h4>M-mode</h4>

<p>
The M-mode was the first ultrasound modality to record display moving echoes from the heart [<a href="http://folk.ntnu.no/stoylen/strainrate/References.html#r118">118</a>], and thus the motion could be interpreted in terms of myocardial and valvular function. The M-modes were originally recorded without access to 2-dimensional images.

<a name="Depth_res"></a>
<h4>Depth resolution. Bandwidth:</h4>

<p>
The depth resolution of the ultrasound beam, is the resolution along the beam. This is dependent on the length of the transmitted ultrasound pulse. In a blood / tissue interface, the dividing line can be seen as a bright line, which does not reflect a tissue stricture (typically <span style="font-weight: bold;">NOT the intima</span> , being far too thin to be seen with ultrasound at the present frequences), but the pulse length. This is the reason for the ASE convention, where depths are measured from leading - to - leading edge of the echoes, as this will neutralise the pulse length form measurements.
</p>

<p>
Ideally, the pulse length in imaging (B- and M-mode) should be as short as possible, but this is dependent on the physical properties of the probe. Most probes will ring in the resonance frequency for a few oscillations, and thus produce a pulse with a length of several oscillations. By Fourier analysis, the frequency content of the pulse will be less dispersed, the longer the pulse is. Thus, the pulse length is inversely proportional with the spread of the frequency, i.e. the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">bandwidth</span>  of the pulse, as shown below. This will have consequences for <a href="#doppler">Doppler imaging</a>, where frequencies, and not amplitudes are analysed.

<br>
<a name="pulse_length_frequency"></a>
Higher frequencies will result in
shorter pulses for the same number of oscillations, i.e. reduce pulse
length without increasing bandwidth to the same degree.&nbsp; Thus, for
imaging, the ideal pulse would be highest possible frequency (depending
on the required
<a href="http://folk.ntnu.no/stoylen/strainrate/Ultrasound/#Attenuation">depth penetration</a>
) and the
shortest possible pulse length. However, as noise is unevenly
distributed in different frequency domains,
<a href="http://folk.ntnu.no/stoylen/strainrate/Ultrasound/#Harmonic">
  harmonic
imaging
</a>
, which analyses at half the frequency, will result in less
noise. Harmonic imaging thus doubles the pulse length for a given
frequency, and results in thicker echoes.

  <br>
  <small>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">
      Halving the frequency results
in half the number of oscillations per time unit, or longer time (=
pulse length) for the same number of oscillations. Thus halving the
frequency, as in
      <a href="http://folk.ntnu.no/stoylen/strainrate/Ultrasound/#Harmonic">second harmonic analysis,</a>
      will result in longer pulse length. However, the
      <a href="http://folk.ntnu.no/stoylen/strainrate/Ultrasound/#Depth_res">bandwidth</a>
      is far less affected.

  2-dimensional imaging:
</h4>
A 2-dimensional image is built up by firing a beam vertically, waiting
for the return echoes, maintaining the information and then firing a
new line from a neighboring transducer along a tambourine line in a
sequence of&nbsp; B-mode lines. In a linear array of ultrasound
crystals, the electronic phased array shoot parallel beams in sequence,
creating a field that is as wide as the probe length (footprint). A
curvilinear array has a curved surface, creating a field in the depth
that is wider than the footprint of the probe, making it possible to
create a&nbsp; smaller footprint for easier access through small
windows. This will result in a wider field in depth, but at the cost of
reduced lateral resolution as the scan lines diverge.

The linear array gives a large probe surface (footprint) and near
field, and a narrow sector. A curvilinear array will also give a large
footprint and near field, but with a wide sector.
<br>

But in order to achieve a footprint sufficiently small to get
access to the heart between the ribs, and with a sufficiently wide far
field, the beams has to diverge from virtually the same point. This
means that the image has to be generated by a single beam originating
from the same point, being deflected in different angles to build a
sector image (cf. figs. 6 and 7).
<br>
This can be achieved by a single transducer or array sending a single
beam that is stepwise rotated, either mechanically or electronically.
<br>
A very small footprint can be achieved by a mechanical probe, sending
only one beam, but being mechanically rotated by a motor. Finally with
a slightly larger footprint, a phased array with electronic focusing
and steering, can generate a beam sweeping at an angle similar to the
mechanical probe. Beamforming by phased array, also enables focusing of
the ultrasound beam as shown. Focusing can also be performed in a
mechanical probe, by a concentric arrangement of several ring shaped
transducers, an annular array. This will focus the beam in both
transverse directions at the same time, as indicated in fig. 7A.
<br>
The next line in the image is then formed by a slight angular rotation
, making the beam sweep across a sector:

  2D echocardiography. A line is sent out, and as all echoes along
the beam are received, the picture along the beam is retained, and a
new beam is sent out in the neighboring region. building up the next
line in the image.&nbsp; one full sweep of the beam will then build up
a complete image; i.e one frame. A cine-loop is then a sequence of
frames; i.e. a movie.
</small>
<br>
The present technology is sufficient to&nbsp; build up a picture wit
sufficient depth and resolution with about 50 frames per second (FPS),
which gives a good temporal resolution for 2D visualisation of normal
heart action ( about 70 beats per min.). However, the eye has a
resolution of about 25 frames per second, so there may seem to be
excess information. But off-line replay may be done at reduced frame
rate, thus enabling the eye to utilise a higher temporal resolution.

Focusing is illustrated above. In a mechanical probe, there may be
several transducers, arranged in a circular array, focusing the beam in
a manner analogous to that shown in fig. 7c. In a circular array,
however, the focusing can be done in all directions transverse to the
beam direction, i.e. in the imaging plane and transverse to the plane,
while a linear array can only focus in one direction, in the imaging
plane.

Thus:
<br>
<ul>
  <li>
    The larger the aperture, the higher the resolution of a line.
However, the crucial limitation is the ability to place the aperture
between the ribs. Too big probe footprint will reduce the effective
aperture again, resulting in reduced resolution.
  </li>
  <li>
    The shorter the wavelength (the higher the frequency), the better
the resolution. The limitation for the frequency is the required

The width of the echo will be determined by the beam width, and thus
the distance between the beams (most ultrasound scanners today will
intrapolate between beams if the distance between the beams is greater
than the beam width). Ideally, the distance between the beam width
should be the same as the beam width at the focal depth, for maximal
resolution, thus lateral resolution of a beam determining the

This means that the line density would be suited to the beam width.
This, however, holds only for a linear array.

    In a sector angle, the line density falls with distance from the
probe, as the lines diverge.
    <br></li>
</ul>
However, as the beam width also increases at depths greater than the
focal depth, the ideal line density for a sector probe is the one
where&nbsp; beam
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">
  distances
are equal to the beam width at the focal depth
</span>
. This will give
the best lateral resolution. A line density that is so high as to make
lines overlap, will not result in increased lateral resolution. A line
density that leaves gaps between the lines, will have less than optimal
lateral resolution as determined by the probe aperture and focal depth.
<br>
But as the time it takes to build each line in the image for any given
depth that is desired,
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">
  the
number of beams in an image limits the frame rate
</span>
. And if a
greater sector width is desired without reducing the frame rate, the
line density is reduced (same number of lines over a wider angle).
<br>
Thus,&nbsp; the line density itself is limited by other factors as well:
<br>
<ul>
  <li>
    Frame rate (including the depth).
    <br></li>
  <li>
    Sector width. Increasing sector width has to be compensated
either by lower frame rate&nbsp; or by lower line density (keeping the
same number of lines in a wider sector) as shovn
    <a href="http://folk.ntnu.no/stoylen/strainrate/Ultrasound/#Beam_number">below</a>
    .
And in addition, as the sector width is increasing by depth, the line
density falls correspondingly.
    <br></li>
</ul>
Due to these factors, the line density often falls below the
theoretically desirable described above, and
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">
  the line density, not the probe
size and wavelength becomes the limiting factor
</span>
for the lateral
resolution.

due to lower line density . By rights the image should appear as split
in different lines as indicated in the middle, as each beam is
separated, line density being less than optimal relative to the beam
width. Instead the image is interpolated beween lines. This reduction

          The beams being focussed at a
certain depth mau mean that line density may be inadequate at the focus

default setting will usually give the best line density at the focus
depth, so unless frame rate is increased, this problem may be minor.
Howewever, line density will decrease ifalso if sector width is
increased, there is a given number of lines for a given frame rate and
depth. In any case, in the far field, the beams will be broader, and
the beam width will be more like A and C.

Thus, the line density can be increased by

<ol>
  <li>
    Reducing the sector width (gives higher line density by spreading
the lines over a smaller angle)
    <br></li>
  <li>
    Reducing frame rate (enables time for builing more lines between

    <br></li>
  <li>
    Reducing depth (enables a higher line density for a given frame
rate, as the shorter lines takes shorter time to build).
    <br></li>
</ol>
This is discussed in detail below:
<br>
<h4>
  <a name="temporal"></a>
  Temporal resolution (frame rate):
</h4>
To imagine moving objects, structures such as blood and heart, the
frame rate is important, related to the motion speed of the object. The
eye generally can only see 25 FPS (video frame rate), giving a temporal
resolution of about 40 ms. However, a higher frame rate and new
equipment offers the possibility of replay at lower rate, f.i. 50 FPS
played at 25 FPS, which will in fact double the effective resolution of
the eye.
<br>
In quantitative measurement, whether based on the
<a href="http://folk.ntnu.no/stoylen/strainrate/Ultrasound/index.html#The_Doppler_effect">
  Doppler
effect
</a>
or 2D B-mode data, sufficient frame rate is important to
avoid
<a href="http://folk.ntnu.no/stoylen/strainrate/Howto/Pitfalls.html#sampling">undersampling</a>
.&nbsp;
In
Doppler, the frame rate is also important in the&nbsp;
<a href="http://folk.ntnu.no/stoylen/strainrate/Ultrasound/index.html#Nykvist">
  Nykvist
phenomenon.
</a>
<br>
The temporal resolution&nbsp; is limited by the sweep speed of the
beam. And the sweep speed is limited by the speed of sound, as the echo
from the deepest part of the image has to return before the next pulse
is sent out ad a different angle in the neighboring beam.
<br>
<h5>
  <a name="Depth"></a>
  Depth
  <br></h5>
If the desired depth is reduced, the time from sending to receiving the
pulse is reduced, and the next pulse (for the next beam) can be sent
out earlier, thus increasing sweep speed and frame rate, as shown
below.
<br>
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
  <tbody>
    <tr>

      <td style="vertical-align: top;">
        <small>
          
          As the depth&nbsp; of the sector
determines the time before next pulse can be sent out, higher depth
results in longer time for building each line, and thus longer time for
building the sector from a given number of lines, i.e. lower frame rate.
        </small>
        <br></td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">
        <small>
          
          Thus reducing the desired depth of
the sector results in shorter time between pulses, and thus shorter
time for building each line, shorter time for building the same number
of lines, i.e. higher frame rate. In this case, the depth has been
halved, and the time for building a line is also halved.
        </small>
        <br></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<br>
For a depth of 15 cm, this means that the time for building one line
will be 2 x 0.15 m / 1540 m/s =&nbsp; 0.19 ms. The frame rate is then
given by the depth and the
<a href="http://folk.ntnu.no/stoylen/strainrate/Ultrasound/#Beam_number">number of lines</a>
,
which again is a function of sector width and line density.
<br>
The important point of this, is that reducing the depth to the field of
interest will give a higher frame rate, that can either be used for
higher temporal resolution, or for increased spatial resolution or
sector width (see later). Looking at commercial scanners, the effect of
reducing depth is often surprisingly little, this may be due to the
manufacturers automatically using the increased temporal capacity to
increase line density rather than frame rate.
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;">
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">
    Still,
the field of view should be limited to the field of interest.

The sweep speed can also be increased by reducing the number of

image will reduce the time for building up the whole image. This can be
achieved by either decreasing the sector angle (width), but keeping the
line density, i.e. reducing the field of view but keeping lateral
resolution. Decreasing the line density, but keeping the same sector

<br>
As can be seen there has always to be a trade off. Frame rate is a
compromise between sector size (width and depth), resolution (line
density) and frame rate. Line density is a trade off with frame rate
and sector width. The fundamental limitation is the speed of sound. In
the example
<a href="http://folk.ntnu.no/stoylen/strainrate/Ultrasound/#Depth">above</a>
for a depth of 12 cm (givig at
time for building one line of 15 ms), with 64 lines, the time for a
full sector is 64 x 0.19 ms = 12.5 ms, and the frame rate is&nbsp; 1000
/ (12.5) = 80.
<br>
<a name="TGC_and_FR_latres"></a>
This is shown in the example below:
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img style="width: 989px; height: 302px;" src="./UltrasoundBasics/FR.GIF">
  <br>
  <div style="text-align: left;">

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        Ultrasound acquisitions of the
same ventricle at frame rate 34 ( left), 56 (middle) and 112 (right),
all other setting being equal. Increased frame rate is achieved by
reducing the number of lines; i.e. the line density. This can be seen
as an increasing width of the speckles in the image with increasing
frame rate, resulting in a lateral blurring of the image. The first
step from 34 to 56 seems to retain an acceptable image quality,
indicating that the line density was&nbsp; redundant&nbsp; at the
lowest frame rate.&nbsp; ( In fact, it may seem that the image in the
middle has the best quality, as the left image seems more grainy. But
the graininess is the real appearance of the echoes, while the more
homogeneous appearance in the middle and the left is due to smearing).
However, as line density decreases toward the bottom of the sector (by
the divergence of the lines), the effect is mos clearly seen here, i.e.
in the atrial walls, the mitral ring and valve.&nbsp; In the image to
the right, the endocardial definition is lost.&nbsp; As it is the
echoes that are smeared, the effect will result in an apparent
decreased cavity size.&nbsp;
        <br>
        These images also illustrates the drawback of
        <a href="http://folk.ntnu.no/stoylen/strainrate/Ultrasound/#Attenuation">
          time

        </a>
        , all three images has the same TGC, showing about
the same brightness of the walls from base to apex, (the attenuation
being offset by the TGC), but with increasing cavity noise.

<a name="mla"></a>
<h5>Multiple line acquisition (MLA)</h5>
However, a method for increasing the frame rate for a given sector and
line density, is to fire a wide transmit beam, and listen on more
narrow receiver beams (crystals) simultaneously. This is called
multiple line acquisition (MLA), and is illustrated below:
<br>
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <img style="width: 560px; height: 506px;" src="./UltrasoundBasics/Sector A.gif">
        <br></td>
      <td>
        <img style="width: 560px; height: 506px;" src="./UltrasoundBasics/Sector A 4mla.gif">
        <br></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<br>
<small>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">
    In this example, a wide beam is
fired, and for each of the four transmit beams, there are four receiver
beams (4MLA). thus, the frame rate is increased fourfold for the same
number of lines.
  </span>
  <br></small>
<small>
  <big>
    <br>
    However, simultaneous reception from neighboring lines will result in
some contamination of the signals from lateral beams, in addition it
will increase the effect of side lobes. This is limited especially in
B-mode, where image quality is the main focus. There will be
interference beween the simultaneous receiver beams, creating a line
pattern, reducing image quality. Smoothing this in the image will
result in "smearing", and thus give much of the effect seen by reducing
line density, and thus there is less gain in the MLA technique. In
tissue Doppler, the image quality is of less concern, as the main
emphasis is on velocity data, rather than image quality. Thus, the MLA
factor, and hence, the frame rate of tissue Doppler is thus usually
higher, but at the cost of lower lateral resolution. This may not be
apparent, unless one compares data across the beams. An example can be
seen
    <a href="http://folk.ntnu.no/stoylen/strainrate/measurements.html#Lateral_resolution">here</a>
    .

<h3>
  <a name="3D"></a>
  3D ultrasound
</h3>
<p>
  3D ultrasound increases complexity a lot, resulting in a new set
of&nbsp; additional challenges.
  <br></p>
<p>
  The number of crystals need to be increased, typically from between
64 and 128 to between 2000 and 3000. However, the probe footprint still
needs to be no bigger than being able to fit between the ribs. And the
  <a href="http://folk.ntnu.no/stoylen/strainrate/Ultrasound/#Lateral">aperture size</a>
  must still be adequate for image
resolution.
  <br></p>
<p>
  The number of data channels increases also by the square, from 64 to
64 <sup>2</sup>
  = 4096. This means that the transmission capacity of the
probe connector needs to be substatially increased, and some processing
has to take place in the probe itself to reduce number of transmission
channels. .
  <br></p>

<p>
  The number of lines also increase by the square of the number for
2D, given the same line density, meaning that&nbsp; each plane shall
have the same number of lines, and a full volume then shall be n=built
by the same number of planes. This means that given 64 lines per plane,
the number of planes should be 64, which means a total of 64 x 64 =
4096 lines. This means that the frame rate (usually termed the "volume
rate" in 3D imaging), will be 0.19 ms x 4096 = 778 ms, or about 0.8
secs. Meaning about 1 volume per heartbeat for a heart rate of 75. This
is illustrated below.

This means that full volume 3D ultrasound has to pay a price of a
substantially reduction in both frame rate and lione density
(resolution) at the same time.
<br>
Possible compensations are:
<br>
<a href="http://folk.ntnu.no/stoylen/strainrate/Ultrasound/#MLA">MLA technique</a>
<br>
Gated acquisition (stitching). In ECG gated mode, a full volume is
taken over multiple heart beats, triggered by the ECG. Thus, the
limitation in 3D sector size can be used both for more lines
(resolution) and shorter acquisition time (increased frame rate). The
disadvantage of this is that each full-volume heart cycle is
constructed from multiple beats, and small movements, f.i. by
respiration may result in mis alignment of wall segments.
