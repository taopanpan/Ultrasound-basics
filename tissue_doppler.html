          Tissue Doppler.
        </h2>
        The Doppler principle can be used both for blood flow and Tissue
velocities. Tissue Doppler was first decribed in 1989 (
        <a href="http://folk.ntnu.no/stoylen/strainrate/References.html#r53">53</a>
        ). It is simply a question of
different filtering of the Doppler signals. The main principle is that
blood has high velocity (Typically above 50 cm/s, although also all
velocities down to zero), but low density, resulting in low intensity
(amplitude) reflected signals. Tissue has high density, resulting in
high intensity signals, but low velocity (typically below 20 cm/s). The
difference in the applications used for the two sets of signals is
mainly differences in filtering, applying a high pass filter in Doppler
flow, and low pass filter in tissue Doppler (Although the latter is not
absolutely necessary).

height ogf the bars, intensdity showb both by the placement on the x
axis, as well as the darkness of the bars, black being the highest
intensity. The flow signals are low intensity but mostly high velocity,
while the tissue is exclusively low velocity, high intensity. The heart
valves, however, are solid structures which moves with the velocity of
the passing blood, resulting in high intensity signals giving a
saturation of the Doppler spectrum. A typical flow curve from the right
ventricular outflow tract is shown to the left, with the valve click.

Velocities lower than the limits of the green bar (showing the range of
the filter) are removed seen in the dark zone in the middle of the
spectrum. The setting rejects velocities at blood intensities below 15
- 20 cm/s, which is too high for normal flow velocities as in this
instance, although may often be useful&nbsp; in continuous wave Doppler
recordings of high velocities in jets.

modern ultrasound machines today has separate applications for tissue

by applying a low pass filter that removes most of the flow velocities.

          <a name="cTDI"></a>
          Colour Tissue Doppler
        </h4>
        The basic principles of colour tissue Doppler are the same as for
        <a href="http://folk.ntnu.no/stoylen/strainrate/Ultrasound/#Colour_doppler">colour flow mode</a>
        (
        <a href="http://folk.ntnu.no/stoylen/strainrate/References.html#r222">222</a>
        ). The difference is the same as
in spectral Doppler flow versus colur Doppler flow, except for the
differences in filtering as shown
        <a href="http://folk.ntnu.no/stoylen/strainrate/Ultrasound/#Tissue_Doppler">above</a>
        .
colour However, the region of interest is the same as in B-mode, being
the myocardium. Thus the solution of a small sector within the B-mode
sector is unfeasible. However, as velocities are measured only along
the ultrasound beams, and cavity signals are filtered by low gain / low
pass filter, the line density need not be high. In addition, as the
data are for numerical analysis, not imaging, artifacts from
        <a href="http://folk.ntnu.no/stoylen/strainrate/Ultrasound/#MLA">MLA</a>
        are unimportant. Thus, high frame rate in a full
B-mode sector is achieved with a very low line density, and a higher
MLA (typically 4). Thus the B-mode and colour Doppler images are
displayed superposed, but the acquisition is interleaved, recording a
multiple of colour Doppler images between each B-mode frame. (For
instance 16 lines acquired by 4 MLA in colour Doppler interleaved with
one B-mode image acquired with 64 lines at 2MLA for every fourth
Doppler image will result in a Doppler frame rate of 160 for a B-mode
frame rate of 40).
        <br>
        Both velocity and strain rate information can be displayed on the
B-mode image, just as in colour flow. However, as seen below, in this
case it does not display location of jets, as most motion and
deformation is fairly more uniform. In addition, shifts are too quick
to visualise entirely.

          <small>
            <big>
              Thus, in colour
tissue Doppler, the main function is to get data for post processing,
either for semi quantitative analysis in curved anatomical M-mode as
shown below, or to extract quantitative data&nbsp; as velocity or
deformation curves.&nbsp; The advantage over pulsed Doppler, is the
near simultaneity of the data over the sector, being important in
comparing regional motion from different segments of the wall. In
colour flow,

              is less important,
and so quantitative information is rather acquired by pulsed or cw
Doppler, giving far higher temporal resolution.

        This method, developed by Lars Åke Brodin and Bjørn Olstad
shows the whole time sequence in one wall at a time. (
        <a href="http://folk.ntnu.no/stoylen/strainrate/References.html#r18">18</a>
        ). By this method, a line is drawn
in the wall, and tissue velocity data are sampled for the whole time
interval (e.g. one heart cycle) and displayed in colour along a line in
a time plot, as shown below. This has the advantage of displaying the
whole sequence in a still picture, giving a temporal resolution like
the frame rate of the 2D tissue Doppler.

          Measurement of peak values in relation to
the Doppler spectrum
        </h4>
        The width of the spectrum in Doppler flow is mainly determined by the
dispersion of velocities. However, the main use of pulsed wave tissue
Doppler is for measuring annulus velocities, and the annulus is stiff,
with propapility of dispersion of velocities. Also, in pulsed tissue
Doppler, the insonation angle is small. Despite this, the spectrum has
a certain width, indicating a spectrum of velocities:

        . Ideally, the most

velocity in the middle of the spectrum), not the maximal value (at the

        In perfect image quality, modal velocity should be equal to
autocorrelation, but in the case there is clutter, autocorrelation
would not give similar values, as clutter would be incorporated into
the mean. In the study above, this was the case with most subjectys,
resulting in a significant difference between modal velocity from
spectral Doppler and autocorrelation. This is firthewr discussed
        <a href="http://folk.ntnu.no/stoylen/strainrate/Ultrasound/#reverb_in_TDI">below</a>
        .
        <br>
        Thus, most of the differences reported between pw Tissue Doppler (

        ,
        <a href="http://folk.ntnu.no/stoylen/strainrate/References.html#r165">165</a>
        ) and colour tissue Doppler are
due to the width of the spectrum. But if so, this would give a good
correlation between methods, and a more or less constant offset (
        <a href="http://folk.ntnu.no/stoylen/strainrate/References.html#r165">165</a>
        ,
        <a href="http://folk.ntnu.no/stoylen/strainrate/References.html#r267">267</a>
        ).

        <br>
        In addition, the width of the spectrum is dependent on the gain
setting. Increased gain setting increases the peak values (
        <a href="http://folk.ntnu.no/stoylen/strainrate/References.html#r117">145</a>
        ) as illustrated below:

              Same
tissue Doppler recording with two different gain settings. We see that
peak systolic velocity differs by 2 cm/s, and the lowest gain setting
              <br>
              is closest to the modal velocity. However, the modal velocity itself,
remains unchanged by the gain setting.

          <div style="text-align: left;">
            <small>
              <big>
                <br>
                It is evident that the modal velocity is closest tio the "true"
velocity, if peak values are used, they should be obtained and analysed
by the lowest readable gain setting.
                <br>
                On the other hand, filtering of the colour tissue Doppler reduces peak
values, and will also increase the&nbsp; difference between the methods
(

                ). Autocorrelation with high
filtering or low frame rate will thus underestimate the true mean
value.

                        Clutter filtering may reduce the problem,
as seen here. There is aa band of clutter close to zero velocities, but
as seen here, the spectral modality makes it very easy to separate the
true and clutter velocities. However, the clutter affects the
autocorrelation velocity (red line), giving lower velocities, but with
clutter filter this effect is removed (red line) , and the peak value
is substantially higher. Image modified from (

                Reverberations are stationary echoes, meaning that the echoes will
incorporate zero velocities (clutter). Most of the reverberation echoes
are in the fundamental imaging frequency. However, harmonic imaging
halves the frequency, and thus the
                <a href="http://folk.ntnu.no/stoylen/strainrate/Ultrasound/#Nykvist">Nykvist limit</a>
                .
This means that there will be aliasing at half the velocity in
harmnonic imaging, compared to fundamental. And this is within the
range of tissue velocities. Thus harmonic imaging is unfeasable in
tissue Doppler, and the harmonic acquisition makes the method more
vulnerable to reverberations than B-mode, as explained

                        In pulsed wave tissue Doppler, the clutter
will show up as a high amplitude band of zero velocities, but the true
velocity curves can be seen as entirely separate from the clutter line,
and thus peak velocities can still be masured.

                Spectral Tissue Dopplere is thus fairly robust against clutter, at it
measures peak values. However, using modal velocity, renders it more
vulnerable.

                Thus, spectral values will incorporate pixels with zero velocity, and
the spectrum will broaden, with a reduction in average velocity due to

about 1.5 - 2 cm/s as shown in the

                Thus, maximum values are more robust in relation to artifacts than both
taking the middle of the spectrum and colour tissue Doppler. For the
present, the best compromise seems to be:

factor, it has proved possible to increase the TDI frame rate

(planar) beams, each covering one wall, as well as 16 MLA and sparse
interleaved B-mode imaging, it has been possible to increase frame rate
to 1200 FPS in 2D imaging. this is the extreme example of exchanging
spatial for temporal resolution.

              The simultaneous measurement of
velocities in the whole sector, enables the measurement of
              <span style="text-decoration: underline;">velocity differences</span>
              . This
is the prerequisite for measuring the velocity gradient or strain rate
by tissue Doppler.
            </span>
            <br>
            Thus, longitudinal velocity gradient, is a measure of longitudinal
strain rate. However, it can be shown that this is equal to the
velocity gradient over a fixed distance. Strain rate by tissue Doppler
measures the velocity gradient of two points over a segment with a
fixed distance (In the latest scanner software, the velocity gradient
is in fact calculated by linear regression of all pixel velocities
within the delta x, to reduce noise.):

velocity gradient, but it can be proved (here) that the two formulas

                respectively, the velocity gradient /
strain rate can be calculated as the slope of the regression line of
all velocities along the offset distance as described originally (

will be identical, both formulas defining the slope. With imperfect
data, this method will tend to make the method less sensitive to errors

variability of the measurements, the measured values deviate from the
slope. Here velocities are sampled for each 0.5 mm along the strain
length (red points), and are seen to be dispersed around the true
strain rate line. The regression line through the points (red line) is
fairly close to the true strain line, and results in a strain rate

                Motion of one kernel can thus be measured throughout one heart cycle.
Velocity can be derived from the motion curve or calculated by the
motion divided by the frame interval. With two kernels, the relative
displacement per distance can be derived. This is equal to strain.
Likewise the relative velocity per distance (velocity gradient / strain
rate) can be calculated or derived from the strain curve.

                Strain by speckle tracking has been validated by ultrasonomicrometry in

                The advantage of this method is that it tracks in two dimensions, along
the direction of the wall, not along the ultrasound beam, and thus is
angle independent. This means true longitudinal strain. The
disadvantage is that if the algorithm does not track one kernel
correctly, the strain values will be wrong for the segments on both

reverberations as shown

                . This can
be overcome by increasing the number of kernels, or manually avoiding
placing a kernel in an area of drop out or reverberation.

                It is important to be aware that
strain measured by speckle tracking&nbsp; is
                <a href="http://folk.ntnu.no/stoylen/strainrate/mathemathics/index.html#strain">Lagrangian strain</a>
                directly. Derivation yields Lagrangian strain rate, while tissue
Doppler yields Eulerian strain rate. Commercially, it has been
customary to display the Eulerian or natural strain rate (
                <a href="http://folk.ntnu.no/stoylen/strainrate/measurements.html#Velgrad">velocity gradient</a>
                ) derived
directly from tissue velocity data, but to apply a
                <a href="http://folk.ntnu.no/stoylen/strainrate/mathemathics/index.html#Integr">correction</a>
                when
integrating to strain rate and display Lagrangian strain. For Strain
rate from speckle tracking, a reverse correction has to be applied,
either calculating velocity from displacement and then strain rate from
velocity, or calculate strain rate from strain and then apply a
conversion. Thus, if Lagrangian strain is derived directly from the
segment length change, the Eulerian strain rate can be derived by the
simple conversion:
                <br>
                <div style="text-align: center;">
                  <img style="width: 112px; height: 40px;" src="./UltrasoundBasics/SR euler fra lagr.GIF">
                  &nbsp;
                  <br></div>
                <br>
                This, however, is not as simple as it looks. As can be seen from the
equation, the formula converts the strain rate at a specific time from
Lagrangian to Eulerian strain rate, but as shown
                <a href="http://folk.ntnu.no/stoylen/strainrate/new.html#difference">above</a>
                , the peak strain rate is not
simultaneous by the two calculations. Thus, peak Lagrangian strain rate
(which is lower than Eulerian), will be converted to Eulerian strain
                <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
                  at the time of peak Lagrangian
strain
                </span>
                , not the peak Eulerian strain itself, so the conversion
is practically useless. This is in contrast to the conversion between
strains, as bot Eulerian and Lagrangian strain are cumulated maximal
strain, which is at end systole and simultaneous.
                <br>
                Speckle tracking can also be combined with tissue Doppler in various
combinations for more efficient tracking as described

                          Velocity traces may be considered
the raw data. All other modalities are integrated or derived from this.
Here normal function is shown at normal basal velocity (6 cm/s), as
well as normal decrease from base to apex.&nbsp; This decrease is
evident by visual assessment alone, as the distance between the curves.
The distance between the curves then is a direct visual assessment of
strain rate.&nbsp; Strain rate curves can be obtained by spatial
derivation of velocity:

displacement, although not used:

however, are noisy, shown in this unfiltered image, the increase in

Strain rate imaging, using the

            , will neutralise this, as usually both velocities in
the equation (V1 - V2)/L are aliased, and thus the difference remains
the same. So in strain rate imaging, aliasing is effectively unwrapped,

        <a href="http://folk.ntnu.no/stoylen/strainrate/Ultrasound/#Speckletrack">above</a>
        . Modern ultrasound equipment has the
capability of acquiring second harmonic greyscale images with an
acceptable frame rate of 40 - 50 FPS and good lateral resolution
simultaneously with tissue Doppler data. This opens the possibility of
tracking along the ultrasound beam by tissue Doppler, simply by
calculating the displacement from one frame to next from the velocity
and frame interval, while tracking transverse to the ultrasound beam
can be done by speckle tracking (

                If the method is used to compute longitudinal velocities or
strain rate, the longitudinal tracking is done with the high sampling
frequency of tissue Doppler, thus reducing the possibility of
undersampling.

                It utilises the full dataset inherent in the combined image.

                  It is not reasonable to assume that
discarding part of the information in the acquisition results in better
data.

                Using tissue Doppler in this way, eliminates the angle
dependency.

            This method can be used in different ways to analyse strain rate
imaging (
            <a href="http://folk.ntnu.no/stoylen/strainrate/References.html#r127">127</a>
            ) as described
            <a href="http://folk.ntnu.no/stoylen/strainrate/index.html#speckle_TVI">here</a>
            and has even been shown to
be clinically useful in stress echo (

            ).
